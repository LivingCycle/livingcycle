## User Research - Direct Feedback

### User Statement (2025-08-14)
> "The app could have national service help line numbers, alerts and alarms throughout the day that remind people of what they need to do, basically just to give them some structure of something telling you what to do.
> 
> See, it's stuff like that helps people like I am. A script takes away the anxiety in a logical minds because I can just read it out loud so its not my thinking, which i would fumble and ultimately hang up. But I'm going to use that exact script and see what they could say.
> 
> Checklists, scripts, and helpful phone numbers - I'll make sure to add stuff like that in the app, that's a good idea waiting to happen
> 
> But yeah, what you listed so far are all good ideas. Numbers, contact info for anyone who needs them, especially scripts. I wouldn't have gotten that far in the conversation without yours."
